# Path-Following-Robot-MCI

This repository holds the code and documentation for the EE/CE 375L/331L Microcontrollers and Interfacing lab project. In this, we are trying to implement a path-following robot with autonomous and manual navigation abilities, collision detection, and picking and dropping a ping pong ball. Our robot will also compete against another robot in an arena to finish a race and avoid collisions.
